There is setup2.py in hero_test that needs to be used to make a .exe file of this.
Just remember that you need to copy sounds!

add more objects and make finding each item a little more dificult.
consider:
adding a pixy in the tree
add a rattle snake or cat you need to avoid or befriend

make a sand castle in the desert
make several rocks with different descriptions


add ctrl to stop sapi and add different speed to sapi

Combat!
make a turn based system that has a menu for combat.
menu will be something like:
stab t
slash s
defend d
special x
no looping, just repeat the focused option.
If they press the hot-key their mode will change to that.
The modes do different dammage or defend against different attacks.
They can view info on each option and change the hot-key by pressing the applications key.
The hot-key will activate the option.
each weapon has its own options

The bear will have 3 attacks:
claw (fast)
eviserate (slow)
rage (increases dammage by 10% for 10 seconds but takes up 1/3 of the special attack bar)

before each attack the bear will make a sound so the player knows what mode to switch to

player has 4 options:
attack (focus on dammage)
parry (defends against claw)
dodge (defends against eviserate, but has a little cool-down before you can do anything else as you get closer in)
special (Will cut the chain if the bear is under 30% HP

player can press h or shift h to hear their health or the bear's health

When the player takes the sword, they will be placed in a different world to practice using the sword. The spearit of the old man comes and casts an ilusion over them.
