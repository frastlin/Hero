#create a way to calculate xp and focused attacks.
#0.4 xp for focused, 0.133 xp for spread, 125% damage boness for focused
#could the boness of the spacific attack equal the calculations, or should I add types?
#create the player class

#get the attack menu and keyconfig menus working with one another

learn how threading works

get the keyconfig menu working with the fight engine

set mobs in the real game and connect fighting with it
tree and bear

add the death sequence and dropping items

check if pyinstaller can be made into doing one .exe file, and a ton of files inside another big file, kind of like py2exe can.

send the prototype out and get feedback:
what are people's thoughts? Where should it go?

redesine the room engine:
make a class for rooms with a dict for exits, the key is the key or call that an item makes on the exit event
on the room changer, you have a start event that is called after everything is loaded and an end event that is called before the player moves to a new place.
I will create a directarry tree that looks like:
locations/start/house.py
objects/start/branch.py

create a module that initiates pygame's screen and runs the for loop for events and returns the key in a tupal (key_name, state, mods)

check out pygame docs and look at the wait function
